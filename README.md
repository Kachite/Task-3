The image above show a part of the coordinate plane (− 10 ≤ x ≤ 10, − 10 ≤ y ≤ 10) with graphs of functions (parabola, line) and shapes (circle, rectangle). The size of one grid cell is 1 (unit). Thus, the parameters of functions and shapes can be uniquely determined from the figure.
The areas into which the plane is divided by graphs and contours of shapes are painted in different colors (white, gray, yellow, orange, blue, green). It is necessary to implement a program that, for a point (x, y), determines the color of the area in which this point falls. We assume that if the point (x, y) falls on the line of the graph of the function or contour of the figure, then the correct answer will be the color of any neighboring area. It is also worth noting that some combinations of lines suggest their intersection outside of the plane fragment shown in the figure, therefore, in order to exclude the uncertainty of the answer, the permissible values (x, y) are only those that fall into the given image.
